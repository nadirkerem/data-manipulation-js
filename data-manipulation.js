// PART 2: PRACTICAL MATH

/*
The distance of the trip, in total, is 1,500 miles.
Your carâ€™s fuel efficiency is as follows:
At 55 miles per hour, you get 30 miles per gallon.
At 60 miles per hour, you get 28 miles per gallon.
At 75 miles per hour, you get 23 miles per gallon.
You have a fuel budget of $175.
The average cost of fuel is $3 per gallon.
*/

/*
How many gallons of fuel will you need for the entire trip?
Will your budget be enough to cover the fuel expense?
How long will the trip take, in hours?

  55: 30,
  60: 28,

Compare the results when traveling at an average of 55, 60, and 75 miles per hour. Which makes the most sense for the trip?

  );
});

// PART 3: FUTURE EXPLORATION
/*
In all of the problems above, there are two tools that would make it much easier to implement the logic we need and to reuse the code to test with different values:
Control flow, which is how we conditionally determine what a program does next. For example, if we exceed our fuel budget, perhaps the program could automatically change the speed it is testing until it finds the optimal speed.
Functions, which are reusable blocks of code, allow us to run pieces of code multiple times without rewriting the code or changing the value of variables in the code itself, like we needed to do above.
