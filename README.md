# Per Scholas JavaScript Assignment

## Overview

This repository contains JavaScript code developed as part of an assignment for the Per Scholas Software Engineering Program. It addresses math problems and practical scenarios involving data manipulation and is designed to showcase the use of basic programming constructs in JavaScript.

## Contents

- **part1.js**: Handles arithmetic checks such as sum validation, odd number counting, and uniqueness among a set of numbers.
- **part2.js**: Calculates fuel requirements, costs, and travel times for different speeds during a road trip.
- **part3.js**: Implements recursive functions to find the optimal travel speed based on fuel budget constraints.

## Usage

To run any of the scripts, you need Node.js or a compatible JavaScript runtime environment. Use the following command in your terminal to execute a specific part:

```bash
node part1.js
node part2.js
node part3.js
```
